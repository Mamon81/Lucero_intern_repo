Roles in an Agile Team

1. What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?

My role in the agile team is a developer since I am a Mobile App Developer intern. I am responsible for building and writing clean testable code designed for mobile devices such as Android or iOS. I contribute to the Agile process by being able to deliver features and improvements of an app/product in small but frequent increments. This allows the team to be able to measure progress based on the results I deliver rather than relying on only documentation. 


2. How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?

My responsibilities often allow me to mostly overlap with the Quality Assurance team (QA). It is necessary that we work together when it comes to testing the code and being able to identify bugs before they reach the user of the product. I also interact with the Product Manager in order to be able to understand the project's vision as well as the tasks needing to be prioritized first. Furthermore, I also interact with the UX Designers in order to ensure that the technical implementation that me and the rest of my team have developed matches the intended user experience that the UX designers have made for the product/app. Lastly, I rely on the Agile Project Manager to help me if ever there are obstacles that might hinder my productivity and I have difficulties solving it on my own.
