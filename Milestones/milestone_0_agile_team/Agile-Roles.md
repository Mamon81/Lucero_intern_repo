Roles in an Agile Team

1. What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?

My role in the agile team is a developer since I am a Mobile App Developer intern. I am responsible for building and writing clean testable code designed for mobile devices such as Android or iOS. I contribute to the Agile process by being able to deliver features and improvements of an app/product in small but frequent increments. This allows the team to be able to measure progress based on the results I deliver rather than relying on only documentation. 


2. How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?

My responsibilities often allow me to mostly overlap with the Quality Assurance team (QA). It is necessary that we work together
