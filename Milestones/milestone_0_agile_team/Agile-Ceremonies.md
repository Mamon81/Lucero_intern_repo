Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration

1. How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?

Agile ceremonies can help with communication and alignment by helping the team be able to stay on the same track and is updated on the current progress of the project. For example, daily stand-ups which are short daily meetings can help the team be synchronized and updated on the current status of the project. By doing daily stand-ups, this can give team members to be able to share short and quick updates as well as open up to any obstacles that can be quickly fixed before they get too big. Furthermore, ceremonies, like Retrospectives, give everyone the chance to talk about what went well during the end of a work cycle and what can be further improved for the next work cycle. In conclusion, agile ceremonies can help a team have better communication and alignment by ensuring that the whole team is moving in the same direction and working on the most important tasks without getting confused or overwhelmed.

2. Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?

For me, the Daily Stand-up meetings are the most important ceremony because it can allow me to open up any questions or clarifications in case I get stuck on a certain task. Since I am just starting out in Focus Bear, this means I'm still currently on the onboarding process wherein I familiarize myself with the company and their workflow. There is also a chance wherein I might encounter issues or obstacles that I might not be able to solve on my own. By speaking up during the stand-up meetings on my current progress and whether or not I have been encountering issues, I can be able to get quick feedback or help from the rest of my team in order for me to progress in my current task.
