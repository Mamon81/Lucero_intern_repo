Working in an Agile Team

1. What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

One of the biggest benefits of the Agile method is that it involves being able to deliver a task or output quickly and can easily adapt to change. This ensures that the final product is able to truly meet a client or user's needs rather than following a set and final plan. Furthermore, by breaking works and tasks into smaller increments, teams can catch errors early and be able to pivot based on real-time feedback, which is essential in Focus Bear as it is a dynamic app and requires constant updates and improvements. Meanwhile, one of the biggest challenges in the Agile method is its lack of a traditional long-term roadmap, Due to the flexibility of Agile, it can lead to poorly defined project goals which can cause constant changes, over-scoped requirements, and difficulty in delivering the final product.
