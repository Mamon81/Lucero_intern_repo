Agile Workflows & Kanban

1. How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

Kanban helps manage priorities and avoid overload due to how they visualize tasks and its use of Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits. By mapping out and categorizing tasks onto different columns such as "In Progress" and "Backlog", the team is able to fully see their entire workflow. This also allows the Product Manager to be able to better prioritize the most valuable tasks by placing it at the top of the backlog, letting developers be aware of what to pull next and do. Meanwhile, using WIP limits protects team members from overcommiting and being overwhelmed by the nummber of tasks needed to be done. It forces the team members to focus on finishing current tasks before starting new ones, eliminating the stress of multitasking.


2. How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

I can improve my workflow using Kanban principles by first focusing on making small but manageable adjustments to my work routine instead of a large change to my routine and habits. I will use my existing work schedule as a basis and slowly integrate Kanban practices such as using a Kanban board in order to track my tasks and properly vizualize my progress. I should also respect my current role as a developer and its responsibilties by being able to master and understand the tasks I'm given within my team's existing system. Lastly, I should be a proactive member of my team by speaking up whenever I notice a bottleneck or obstacle that is preventing me from completing my current task. By applying these improvements using Kanban principles, it would greatly improve my workflow as well.
