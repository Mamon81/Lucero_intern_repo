Merge Conflicts & Conflict Resolution 

1. What caused the conflict?

The conflict was caused when I attempted to merge my conflict-branch branch into main wherein the contents of the git_understanding.md file for both branches were different. For the conflict-branch branch, it had listed down questions talking about my experience with merge conflicts. Meanwhile, the main branch didn't have any questions and placed down only the numbers instead with no questions yet. When I tried to merge the conflict-branch into my main branch, a conflict occurred. 

2. How did you resolve it?

I resolved it manually keeping the incoming changes which were the changes from the conflict-branch. I then commited the merge to complete the merge once that there were no more conflicts.

3. What did you learn?

I learned the importance of solving merge conflicts when working on different branches. If more developers will start working on a single repository, there should be better communication on the types of changes done when merging branches as there can be potential conflicts that can occur. If there are merge conflicts, I should properly review the incoming changes and compare it with the current changes to ensure that nothing important has been overwritten.
