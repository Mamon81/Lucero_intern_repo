1. What do you hope to learn from this internship?

I hope to be able to learn what it's like to work in a much bigger group setting when developing apps as this would be my first time being part of a company or organization since the projects I've been a part of are academic projects or projects that are a part of my curriculum. I would also like to further learn about a company's workflow and experience what it's like in a more professional setting. Furthermore, I would also like to not only learn new skills and company practices but also be able to further hone the skills that I currently have.

2. What skills are you most excited to develop?

I'm most excited to further develop honing my mobile app development skills since I've only been involved in one project involving developing a mobile application as well as be able to learn React as this is my first time using React in a project. In addition, I am most excited to develop standard company practices when designing and developing Focus Bear's app.

3. What do you think you can contribute to the team?

As a mobile app developer intern, I believe I can contribute to the team with my knowledge on mobile app development as one of my projects that I was involved in allowed me to develop a mobile application (specifically for Android). This means that I have some knowledge on using Flutter the framework as the aim of our mobile app development course was to use Flutter since it a framework that can build multi-platform applications from a single codebase, allowing us to be able to write an application's logic and user interface once and be able to deploy it for multiple operating systems and devices such iOS, Android and even Windows. In addition, since Flutter utilizes Dart as a programming language, I also have experience with using said programming language which could be essential to the mobile app development team. 

4. What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?

Aside from my knowledge in React, I also would like to further improve on being able to communicate well with my fellow team members and peers. I have no trouble with communicating with my group mates when working on my school projects. However, this is my first time working on a project in a professional setting and I would like to not only improve on coding and standard company practices but also learn to be more comfortable with sharing my progress and not be afraid to ask for help.

5. What does success in this internship look like for you?

After this internship, my definition of success in this internship is that I am not only more knowledgeable and skilled when it comes to mobile app development but also gained real life experience working in a company. I also am able to have knowledge in using React as well as be more open to my peers and coworkers in future projects that I get the opportunity to be a part of. In addition, thanks to Focus Bear's app, I am also able to improve more on my habits and be able to be less distracted than before.
