1. What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

After researching on similar apps such as Focus Bear, there are some differences that make Focus Bear different from said apps. First off, apps such as Tiimo and Routinery are primarily focusing on a single feature which is routine tracking and do not involve blocking distracting applications or sites. Focus Bear not only creates healthy habits and routines but also stops users from getting distracted on their work by steering them away from distracting sites. Furthermore I've also observed that apps that do include blocking distracting websites and sites such as Freedom and Cold Turkey don't utilize AI to determine if a website or app is distracting and its criteria for blocking is dependent on a user's whereas Focus Bear's AI can evaluate if an opened site or app align's with the user's current focus session. Though its one drawback to the AI feature is that it is blocked by a paywall and is not available in the free version of Focus Bear.

2. If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

As mentioned before, I would choose Focus Bear over competitors as some of the other apps do not involve blocking distracting sites and apps. For me, it is essential to not only develop healthy habits and routines but also prevent myself from using distracting apps such as TikTok or Facebook while I'm performing said habits. Furthermore, with Focus Bear's feature of starting focus sessions, it has allowed me to properly time out my tasks for the day while ensuring that I am not easily distracted with its blocking features. While in a focus session, I can also be able to see the duration of my focus session and be able to plan out the tasks needed to be done during my focus session to get a clearer understanding on my goals for the focus session.

3. What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

For me, one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn't have is a more visually pleasing and engaging aesthetic when planning habits or routines. Apps like Tiimo and Routinery utilize colorful icons, and visual timelines to show users what exactly they should be doing during a specific time. Though Focus Bear offers a way to list down one's morning and evening routines as well show a visual representation of their duration, its interface is more text-oriented or visualized as a list. It would be nice that it would be displayed in a way that allows the user to visualize the flow of an entire day using color-coded blocks.

4. Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?

As mentioned before, I think one improvement I think Focus Bear could make is a more visually pleasing interface when displaying habits. It could be in the form of a time table with color blocks displaying a user's habits. I feel that with this improvement, it could improve usability with the app since users are inclined to follow their habits or routines if they can have a visual timeline that can display it.
