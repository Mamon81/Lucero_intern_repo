# Static Analysic Checks in CI/CD

## What is CI/CD and Its Importance in Software Development

CI/CD is a DevOps practice that focuses on the automation of the release process of software using three key concepts: Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment. Continuous Integration ensures that the development team integrates their code on a regular basis to ensure that automated builds are carried out, which can detect errors at an early stage. Continuous Delivery extends the concept of Continuous Integration by ensuring that the code is always ready to be deployed to a testing environment, while Continuous Deployment takes it further by ensuring that all tested changes are deployed to the production environment. By automating these different key concepts, teams can achieve faster release cycles, reduce manual errors, and maintain higher software quality through consistent low-risk updates.

## Reflection on Static Analysis Checks in CI/CD

1. What is the purpose of CI/CD

2. How does automating style checks improve project quality?

3. What are some challenges with enforcing checks in CI/CD?

4. How do CI/CD pipelines differ between small projects and large teams?
