Setting Up A Terminal Client

1. Which terminal client did you choose? Why?

I chose Windows Terminal + Powershell since I'm using Windows as my operating system. In addition, I have some experience with using both Windows Terminal + Powershell, so I am a bit familiar with how it works. 

2. What customizations (if any) did you make?

I made only a bit of changes in terms of the color scheme as well as the font face.

3. What was the most useful command you learned today?
