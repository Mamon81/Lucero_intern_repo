Setting Up A Terminal Client

1. Which terminal client did you choose? Why?

I chose Windows Terminal + Powershell since I'm using Windows as my operating system. In addition, I have some experience with using both Windows Terminal + Powershell, so I am a bit familiar with how it works. 

2. What customizations (if any) did you make?

I made only a bit of changes in terms of the color scheme as well as the font face.

3. What was the most useful command you learned today?

The most useful commands I learned today is the Get-Process and Stop-Process command. For Get-Process, it allows to be able to quickly identify what is currently running on my device, so in cases wherein my device starts slowing down, I can quickly track the process that is consuming a lot of memory (RAM). Meanwhile the Stop-Process can allow me to stop a process immedietely without having to manually closing it itself which can help me save a lot of time and frustration in cases wherein a process doesn't close normally.
