1. Which shortcuts do you think will be the most useful in your daily work?

For me, the shortcuts that I think will be the most useful in my daily work are the following:

- Ctrl + P

While coding or doing my tasks, I often need to open dozens of files at the same time. Instead of manually exploring each folder and finding the file I want, I can easily search up the file immediately.

- Alt + Up Button / Down Button

While coding, I might need to rearrange or reorder lines of code. Using this shortcut is a safer and faster method when arranging my lines of code instead of simply cutting and pasting.

- Ctrl + F: Find & Ctrl + H: Replace

If I'm looking for a specific word or variable quickly without having to scroll through hundreds of lines of code to find it, Ctrl + F is a useful shortcut for me to use

Meanwhile, if I want to swap a specific word for a different word everytime it appears across the file, I can use Ctrl + H. By using Ctrl + H, I can easily replace a variable name and have it be updated everywhere else at once.

2. How can keyboard shortcuts improve your productivity?

Keyboard shortcuts can improve my productivity by reducing the number of times I use my mouse. It reduces the need for me to use my mouse whenever I navigate through different menus or clicking things multiple times, allowing me to save more time when doing my work. Furthermore, by avoiding using the mouse, it can allow me to be more focused in the work I'm doing without being distracted by manually looking for files or a specific line of code. Lastly, using keyboard shortcuts can reduce errors when it comes to using the mouse such as replacing a specific variable name all at once rather than individually finding and replacing each name, making data entry and editing more precise.
