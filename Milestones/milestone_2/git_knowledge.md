Set up git locally

1. Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?

I have used Git before in numerous school projects that I have been a part of. Since most of our final projects in school was done in groups, we utilized Git in order to easily share our progress of code as well as working asynchronously on our assigned tasks without the risk of breaking someone else's task. In addition, it also allowed us to properly document any changes made to our code, who made the change, and when they applied the change. 

2. Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?

The Git client that I chose was Git in VS Code. Since I would be mostly utilizing VS Code in my work, I decided to use Git in VS Code so that I can be able to initiate Git commands quicker without having to leave VS Code. Furthermore, since I've been using VS Code for a long time, I've also gotten familiar with using Git in VS Code as well. Lastly, it can also allow me to better review and compare changes to my code in cases wherein merge conflicts occur since I can just simply compare the different commits side-by-side using VS Code as well as better identify which lines of code have been modified. 

3. What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?

The most important thing I learned recently about Git today is that I can easily close issues as part of my commit message without having to manually closing it in Github. Most of the issues I have closed before this task required me to manually close and add a comment on where the file is located. I didn't know that I can just simply mention the issue number in my commit message, so that when I push my latest change to my repository, it simultaneously closes the issue related to the change and also links the change to the issue, allowing it to better trace the change itself. I'm still trying to get used to it, since this is also one of the first times I've dealt with issues in the repository since our previous projects didn't use issues in Github.
