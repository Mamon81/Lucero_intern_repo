Set Up AI Tools for Development

1. Which AI tools did you try?

The AI tools I tried was only GitHub Copilot since it was easily available on VS Code as an extension, allowing the AI coding assistant to easily analyze my code. For Claude AI, its extension in VS Code required a paid subscription.

2. What worked well? What didn’t?

To start off with testing GitHub copilot, I first prompted the AI assistant to write a C program that will prompt the user to input the correct numeric passcode that is already predefined in the code. The user is given only three times to enter the correct passcode. If the user is able to input the correct passcode, the program will display "ACCESS GRANTED", otherwise it will display "ACCESS DENIED" after three attempts. Github Copilot was able to provide a simple program that provided exactly what I asked for. It also added a line of code wherein if the user doesn't input a numeric passcode, it informs the user that it's an invalid input and exits the program. It also suggested me with options that can further improve the program which they are able to do if I prompted them even further. In summary to the code snippets provided by Github Copilot, they were able to provide exactly what I asked for with some areas needed for improvement that can be applied by me or by the assistant if prompted.

In terms of letting AI debug a simple problem, I used the same code snippet from before and edited it so that it gives the user four attempts to input a passcode instead of three. I then asked AI what was wrong with my code and why it's giving the user four attempts to guess four attempts instead of three and the AI assistant not only was able to fix it immediately onto my code, but also explained why the problem was occuring and offering suggestions on improving the code such as making the remaining tries visible to the user. In summary in regards to letting AI debug a simple problem, it was able to deliver what was intended with additional explaination and suggestions on what was fixed and what can be improved.

Lastly, I asked AI on the concept of closing issues when committing and the AI assistant was able to give a brief explaination on the topic and give me an example commit message illustrating how I can close an issue as part of the commit message. It also offered me the option to let me tell it my repo's workflow so that it can show me the exact commands and a sample commit message format to use. In summary, it was able to give me a brief summary on my concept. I was able to understand a bit more on the concept thanks to what the AI assistant gave to me.

3. When do you think AI is most useful for coding?

I think AI is most useful for coding when it comes to debugging errors in the code. By using AI to be able to analyze errors in my code, AI not only analyzes them to pinpoint the exact error but also suggest possible fixes to them as well. Furthermore, while AI is great for debugging my code, it's still important for me to be able to understand why the bug occurred and how to prevent it from occuring again. In addition, AI is also the most useful when it comes to trying to understand a difficult concept that needs further explanation. If I start to utilize unfamiliar languages or libraries, AI can be used in order to speed up the learning process to familiarize said languages and libraries.
