1. When should you use Redux instead of useState?

I should use Redux when the data of my app/system needs to be shared globally across the app's different pages or sections. By using Redux, this also saves me a lot of time of passing along data through a long chain of components using useState. Furthermore, Redux is used for handling complex data that many people on a team need to work with at once. If I need to save data so that it doesn't disappear when I move between different pages of the app, then I should use Redux instead of useState. useState is best used for private data that is only used for one component in my app/system only.
