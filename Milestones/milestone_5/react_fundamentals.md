# Setting Up A React Project

## Reflections on Setting Up A React Project

1. What challenges did you face during setup?

The main challenge that I faced during setup was trying to install Tailwind CSS and configure it to my React Project. What I was initially following during the setup when I searched online had made me encountered errors when setting up Tailwind. I didn't realize that there was already a latest version of Tailwind CSS which was Tailwind CSS v4 and that I was using older commands in setting up Tailwind CSS, resulting in the terminal logging crashes. Aside from that, I had no issues during the setting up of a React Project with Tailwind CSS.

## Understanding Components & Props

1. Why are components important in React?

Components are important in React as they serve as the basic building blocks needed to create your system. They allows developers to be able to break the complexity of their UI into smaller and manageable pieces. By utilizing components, it allows me to be able to create a specific item in my UI like a button and be able to reuse throughout the rest of my system. This not only saves me time but also prevents me from duplicated code. Lastly, it also makes the system easier to maintain. Since components consist of smaller pieces of your complex system, it makes updates to a specific part of the system easier to implement since it will only be applied to its corresponding component.
