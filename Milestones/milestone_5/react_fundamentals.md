# Setting Up A React Project

## Reflections on Setting Up A React Project

1. What challenges did you face during setup?

The main challenge that I faced during setup was trying to install Tailwind CSS and configure it to my React Project. What I was initially following during the setup when I searched online had made me encountered errors when setting up Tailwind. I didn't realize that there was already a latest version of Tailwind CSS which was Tailwind CSS v4 and that I was using older commands in setting up Tailwind CSS, resulting in the terminal logging crashes. Aside from that, I had no issues during the setting up of a React Project with Tailwind CSS.
