Professionalism at Focus Bear

REFLECTION:

1. Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?

During the projects I have previously worked in with my groupmates, I was able to experience that there was great teamwork and professionalism with my group mates. Aside from the fact that we include casual talk from time to time, considering that my groupmates are also my friends, there is still active participation and teamwork when working on my projects. What made it effective is that there is constant communication not only face to face but also through messages as well. There is also clear message in terms of the progress updates as well as clarifications on the project. There is no aggressive language present to instill a negative environment and everyone is open to helping others or asking for help.

2. What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?

- Provide full context in my messages to minimize back-and-forth messaging as well as to prevent follow up questions

- Use simple, direct and friendly messages to avoid confusion

- Respect your teammates' boundaries by using asynchronous modes of communication like email for non-urgent tasks and respecting "Do Not Disturb" status indicators

- Accomodate different communication styles (visual, written, or audio) and ensuring that remote team members or those in different time zones have an equal opportunity to contribute

3. How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?

I can help create a positive, fun and professional work environment by being a proactive team player. This can be done by offering to help others with the best of my abilities and maintaining a positive demeanor even during difficult tasks or situations. I should also practice respectful communication by listening actively and providing constructive feedback privately instead of publicly.

4. How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?

I can prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues by first reading all project briefs, on boarding guides or reviewing details regarding your tasks. I should also take the lead by creating a clear agenda and sending a Google Calendar invite that specifies its purpose or project name if you're the one requesting a meeting. Lastly, always be prepared with simple but friendly questions as well as a summary of your current progress so that the meeting won't take a long time.

5. What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?

Being proactive during my internship involves me taking the initiative. This is done by actively doing the tasks given instead of waiting for instructions by my supervisor. If I am stuck on a task and have already asked for help from the Internet and AI, I should not be afraid to immediately ask for help from other teammates or my supervisor. Furthermore, I should be open to asking for feedback regarding my progress and understand their feedback and suggestions with an open mind. I should also give regular updates on my progress to my team at the end of every workday so that my other teammates are also informed and could offer suggestions with my progress.

6. How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?

To follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them, I should use a tiered communication strategy which is dependent on the urgency of my request. For general or low-priority information, I should start with communicating through Email and allow for a 48-hour response window before nudging. If the matter is of medium-priority such as a task that is due the following day, I should escalate to communicating on Discord and expect a reply within 24 hours. If I do not receive a response within these timeframes, and the lack of information is blocking my progress, I should escalate to communicating via SMS for urgent needs requiring a response within 2, and reserve a direct phone call only for true emergencies. I should first follow the lightest way of communicating so that it ensures that I am being proactive about my issues without unnecessarily interrupting my supervisor's deep work.

7. What are some things you won't do?

I should avoid "ghosting " my project by failing to provide updates or not doing my tasks at all, since no news can cause confusion. I should not come to meetings unprepared or ask simple questions that can be answered immediately through the Internet or AI. Furthermore, I should not ignore feedback from my teammate, repeat the same mistakes, make up excuses for missed deadlines, or multitask during meetings when my full attention is required.
