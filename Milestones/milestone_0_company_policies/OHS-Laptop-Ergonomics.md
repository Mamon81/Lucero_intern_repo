REFLECTION:

1. What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)

To improve my workspace setup, I should ensure that my external monitor is mounted at the correct height. This can be done by using a monitor arm so that the top third of the screen is at eye level. I should also utilize an external keyboard and mouse and ensure that it is correctly positioned so that my wrists are straight and my elbows are at a 90-degree angle. Additionally, I should ensure that my ergonomic chair is adjusted so that the lumbar support fits the curve of my lower especially during long coding sessions. 

2. What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)

I should ensure that I am practicing proper posture everytime I am working by keeping my back against the backrest and that my head is aligned over my shoulders. This avoids "turtling" which involves leaning my head forward toward the screen, resulting in neck and shoulder pain. I should also start incorporating blinking a lot to keep my eyes hydrated and preventing tired or dry eyes. Lastly, I should also use Focus Bear to schedule breaks that require me to move around and take my eyes off from the screen.

3. How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)

I can remind myself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day by using Focus Bear. Not only does it block my screen so that I can do mandatory movement, but I can also insert during my morning routine the habit of checking my desk setup, to ensure that my workplace setup can allow me to maintain good posture such as verifying my monitor height and chair alignment. Lastly, I can also add micro breaks that involve steering my eyes away from the screen and to stay hydrated. Thanks to Focus Bear, I can ensure that my deep-work sessions are balanced with physical movement necessary to prevent long-term musculoskeletal issues.
