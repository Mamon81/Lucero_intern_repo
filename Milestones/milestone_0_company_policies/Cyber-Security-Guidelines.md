Cyber Security

REFLECTION:

1. What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?

The security measures that I currently use a long unique password for my accounts as well utilize 2FA for some of my accounts such as my Google, Discord to name a few. It can be further improved if I use a password manager and using unique passwords for the accounts I have.

2. How can you make secure behavior a habit rather than an afterthought?

Check every start of the month for any software updates and review account permissions as well as check every start of the week for any alerts or any attempts of a security breach in my accounts.

3. What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?

Update software against security vulnerabilities.

Enable two - factor authentication on all accounts.

Use a password manager to manage one's passwords and to be able to generate long, unique, and complex passwords for each account.

4. What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?

If a security breach or any suspicious activity is suspected on my account, I will immediately secure my account by changing passwords, check if there's any suspicious activity if I have 2FA enabled. If not, I will enable 2FA and immediately sign out of all active sessions/devices. I would also review any recent actvity for unauthorized changes or unusual behavior, report the incident to my company and scan my devices for any malware.
