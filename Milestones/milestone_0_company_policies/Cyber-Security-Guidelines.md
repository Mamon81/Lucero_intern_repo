Cyber Security

RESEARCH AND LEARN:

1. What are the common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?

Some common cyber security threats in a remote work environment include phishing, unsecured home/public Wi-Fi, malware/ransomware, and using poor password practices.

2. What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?

Some of the best practices for keeping one's devices and accounts secure is to use strong, unique passwords, enable two factor authentication (2FA) on all accounts and ensure one's operating system and software is constantly updated to patch known security flaws.

3. Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?

Locking my computer when leaving away from my desk is crucial in order to prevent unauthorized physical access to not only my personal data but also my company's data and source code. Even when working at home, an unlocked device is vulnerable to tampering if someone else is present.

4. How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?

I should handle phishing attempts and suspicious links by not clicking said links, not downloading attachments, and verifying the sender's email domain. Immediately report, delete or ignore any suspicious messages. Furthermore, inform your company and your coworkers to be wary of any suspicious messages and links that you've received in order to let them be wary if they receive any as well.

5. What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?

A strong password is at least 16 characters or more, should be unique to each account and should contain a complex mix of uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers and symbols to reduce the chance of getting hacking. Furthermore, the use of a password manager allows you to generate random complex, different passwords for each account without the need to memorize as well as stores all your credentials in an encrypted vault.

6. Why is two - factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?

Two - factor authentication (2FA) is important, because it add another layer of security beyond requiring a password when logging into your account. It should be enabled on every account that support 2FA, especially for emails and work accounts.

REFLECTION:

1. What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?

The security measures that I currently use a long unique password for my accounts as well utilize 2FA for some of my accounts such as my Google, Discord to name a few. It can be further improved if I use a password manager and using unique passwords for the accounts I have.

2. How can you make secure behavior a habit rather than an afterthought?

Check every start of the month for any software updates and review account permissions as well as check every start of the week for any alerts or any attempts of a security breach in my accounts.

3. What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?

Update software against security vulnerabilities.

Enable two - factor authentication on all accounts. 

Use a password manager to manage one's passwords and to be able to generate long, unique, and complex passwords for each account.

4. What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?

If a security breach or any suspicious activity is suspected on my account, I will immediately secure my account by changing passwords, check if there's any suspicious activity if I have 2FA enabled. If not, I will enable 2FA and immediately sign out of all active sessions/devices. I would also review any recent actvity for unauthorized changes or unusual behavior, report the incident to my company and scan my devices for any malware.

TASKS:

Document Habit: I will perform a security audit every Monday wherein I will check for any suspicious activity to ensure no unrecognized devices are logged in. I will also check for any pending updates for the software I use.
