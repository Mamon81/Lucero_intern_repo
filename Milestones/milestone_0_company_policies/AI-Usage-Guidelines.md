REFLECTION:

1. When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?

I use AI for assistance when I'm currently stuck on an issue and has been searching on the net to no avail to solving the issue. I also can use AI for assistance when it comes to organizing my ideas and polishing any drafts that I've written. Lastly, AI is helpful when I need further understanding with topics that are either overwhelming or difficult to understand all at once. During these moments, AI not only helps in saving time but also gives me a better understanding with any issue I encounter. 

At the same time, I should reply on my skills when the specific task requires decision making and creativity. Tasks that involve making decisions, forming opinions and solving deep and complex problems are some of the things that AI is unable to fully help me. These scenarios are also helpful for allowing me to fully be able to learn on my own rather than rely on AI. AI should only be there to support your thinking and opinions and not replace them. 

2. How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?

I  can avoid over-reliance on AI by first solving problems manually or on my own to first assess and understand the problem on my own. Instead of treating AI as a replacement, think of AI as an assistant so that majority to ensure that problems are mostly solved by humans with a bit of help only from AI. In addition, always verify any AI - generated content to ensure that the information is correct and factual.

3. What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?

I will strictly avoid inputting any personal or sensitive information into AI prompts to prevent any data leaks seeing as AI tools are open and public - facing. Instead of using sensitive or personal data into AI prompts, use placeholders, fake names or general description before sending data to an AI model.
