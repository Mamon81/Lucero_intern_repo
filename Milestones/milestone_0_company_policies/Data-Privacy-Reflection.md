Data Privacy and Confidentiality

REFLECTION:

1. What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?

To ensure that I handle data securely in my daily tasks, I should do the following:

- I should strictly follow the principle of data minimization by only collecting or accessing the specific information required for the current task I'm doing

- I should use strong authentication methods like multi-factor authentication to add more security layers, making it difficult for those without authorized access to access the data

- Ensure that all files, databases and communications are protected with robust encryption to prevent them from being accessed to unauthorized users

- I should use private and secure networks when doing work activities and regularly reviewing access permissions to ensure that data is only available to those who need it for their roles

2. How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?

When storing sensitive information safely, it should be stored in encrypted environments, such as Focus Bear's double-encrypted habit databases, and should be shared only through secure, authorized channels instead of public platforms or unsecured Wi-Fi.

When sharing sensitive information safely with my colleagues and teammates, I should ensure that it is directed only to the intended personnel and that any physical documents are kept in locked places when not in use.

When disposing sensitive information safely, digital storage must be securely wiped while physical information should be shredded to ensure that confidential details cannot be recovered or accessed after they are no longer needed.

3. What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?

Some common mistakes that can lead to data privacy issues include human errors such as sending confidential information to the wrong person/email, using weak passwords, or falling for phishing attacks which can compromise login credentials. These mistakes can be avoided by double-checking recipients before sending the email, utilizing password managers, and to never click on any suspicious links or download attachments from unknown sources.
