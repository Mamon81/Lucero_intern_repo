Working with Vulnerable Populations

REFLECTION:

1. How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?

I can adjust my communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates by ensuring that there is clarity or a clear understanding when communicating with them. This can be done by using literal language and avoiding metaphors or sarcasm since it can easily be misinterpreted. I should be able to provide information through different channels or modes such as through writing, through video calls or through visual aids to better accomdate how they prefer to communicate or process information.

2. What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?

Some common UX pitfalls or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive can be the following:

- The possibility of experienc over-blocking wherein the app could block necessary tools or websites during a focus session, creating frustration for the user instead of support

- Having a forced routine being enforced onto the user that cannot be adjusted or skipped can be a hindrance for users who need flexibility due to schedules or fluctuating energy levels.

- Experiencing cluttered interfaces such as too many features, buttons or informational prompts all at once at a single screen

- Having a high - stimulation design such as bright, flashing colors or lights, loud sounds or excessive animations.

- Having vague or unclear instructions when informing the user on how to use the features of their app correctly.

- Having difficulty when first initializing and setting up the app as too much configuration can result in users abandoning the app immediately.

- Having unresponsive support when users experience bugs and errors when using the app.

3. What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?

One practical change I can make in my work to better support vulnerable populations is through the way I can communicate with them. As mentioned before, it can be done by using simple and plain language and ensure that there is no confusion during the conversation. I can offer different ways of communicating with them such as visual, written or audio to better accomodate how they would like to communicate. By using simple, clear and direct language, it can ensure that the information is conveyed and understood and preventing them from feeling overwhelmed or confused.
