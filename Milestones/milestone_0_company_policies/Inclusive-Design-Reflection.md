Working with Vulnerable Populations

RESEARCH AND LEARN:

1. Who are considered vulnerable populations, and what challenges might they face in digital spaces?

In the context of digital spaces, vulnerable populations refer to groups or individuals that face a higher risk of being excluded, exploited or experience due to a number of factors. These can range from social marginalization, limited resources or inherent characteristices. The most frequently identified vulnerable groups include: (Elderly, children, people with disabilities, ethnic minorities, LGBT individuals, Low - income individuals). These groups often face numerous challenges in digital spaces such as limited digital literacy or experiencing difficulty with using websites and apps due to accessibility standards or having poorly designed user interfaces. 

2. What ethical considerations are important when designing or working with neurodivergent individuals? (Hint: Avoid overwhelming UX, respect sensory needs, ensure clear communication.)

When designing with neurodivergent individuals, it is important to consider the user interface of the website/app. It is important to ensure that there is reduced sensory overload. This can be done by avoiding cluttered layouts, loud or overwhelming sounds and bright/flashing lights or high contrast colors. When it comes to working and interacting with neurodivergent individuals, it is important to use clear and literal language to prevent any confusion during a conversation. Offer information in multiple ways such as text, audio or visual to accomadate how they communicate or process information. 

3. How can you make interactions and content more accessible for people with ADHD or Autism? (e.g., simple language, predictable navigation, reducing cognitive load)

As mentioned before, there should be a focus on minimizing distractions by using a simple, clean and consistent layout in order to ensure that people with ADHD or autism are not overwhelmed when using the app/site. Furthermore, there should be no unnecessary visual clutter present or overwhelming elements such as flashing lights. There should also be predictable navigation by keeping the buttons and menus in the same place when navigating through different pages to ensure that the user doesn't have to be familiar again on how to use the app on every new page. Clear and simple language should be utilized and provide a clear step by step instructions so that users know where they are while using the app/site and what to do next.

4. How can we support neurodivergent team members in a professional setting? (Hint: Be clear in communication, respect different working styles, and allow flexibility.)

Supporting neurodivergent members in a professional setting consists of being able to provide simple and clear instructions when interacting or conversing with them. It is important to converse with them and be able to directly communicate with them in any kind of format (written, visual, audio) to accomodate how they process information. In addition, it is also important to respect their working styles by offering flexible schedules or meeting up in quiet areas to accommodate various sensory and focus needs. 

REFLECTION:

1. How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?

I can adjust my communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates by ensuring that there is clarity or a clear understanding when communicating with them. This can be done by using literal language and avoiding metaphors or sarcasm since it can easily be misinterpreted. I should be able to provide information through different channels or modes such as through writing, through video calls or through visual aids to better accomdate how they prefer to communicate or process information.

2. What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?

Some common UX pitfalls or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive can be the following:

- The possibility of experienc over-blocking wherein the app could block necessary tools or websites during a focus session, creating frustration for the user instead of support

- Having a forced routine being enforced onto the user that cannot be adjusted or skipped can be a hindrance for users who need flexibility due to schedules or fluctuating energy levels.

- Experiencing cluttered interfaces such as too many features, buttons or informational prompts all at once at a single screen

- Having a high - stimulation design such as bright, flashing colors or lights, loud sounds or excessive animations.

- Having vague or unclear instructions when informing the user on how to use the features of their app correctly.

- Having difficulty when first initializing and setting up the app as too much configuration can result in users abandoning the app immediately.

- Having unresponsive support when users experience bugs and errors when using the app.

3. What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?

One practical change I can make in my work to better support vulnerable populations is through the way I can communicate with them. As mentioned before, it can be done by using simple and plain language and ensure that there is no confusion during the conversation. I can offer different ways of communicating with them such as visual, written or audio to better accomodate how they would like to communicate. By using simple, clear and direct language, it can ensure that the information is conveyed and understood and preventing them from feeling overwhelmed or confused.

TASKS:

1. Identify one design or communication improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible.

If possible, when planning routines, we could also offer an option to also provide a visual color-coded timeline to help users better visualize the time when doing their routines. In terms of the colors used, it should be noted that using high-contrast but low saturation colors can prevent the design of the timeline to be overstimulating. This can address the issue of "time blindness" wherein people have a hard time with estimating or managing the passage of time, causing them to experience difficulties with punctuality and deadlines. By offering an alternative of using visual cues instead of offering only written instructions, the interface can become more intuitive and less overwhelming for users with ADHD or autism.
